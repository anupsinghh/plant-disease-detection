# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Model 🌱

## 📌 Overview
This project is a machine learning-based plant disease detection model that identifies and classifies plant diseases from images. The model utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze leaf images and predict the presence of specific diseases, helping farmers and agricultural experts take timely action.

## ✨ Features
- 📷 **Image-Based Detection**: Upload an image of a plant leaf to detect possible diseases.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for accurate classification.
- 🌾 **Multiple Disease Recognition**: Supports the detection of various plant diseases.
- 💻 **User-Friendly Interface**: Can be integrated into mobile or web applications.

## 📂 Dataset
The model is trained on a publicly available plant disease dataset containing labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves. The dataset includes:
- 🌱 Multiple plant species
- 🦠 Various disease categories
- 🖼️ High-quality labeled images

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
- ⚙️ **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- 🏛️ **CNN-Based Model**: Convolutional layers extract features, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
- 🎯 **Output**: Predicted disease category with confidence score.

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anupsinghh/plant-disease-detection.git
   cd plant-disease-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
